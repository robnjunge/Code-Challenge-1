# Code Challenge For Calculating Grade Of A Student 

## Project setup
Start by first creating a repository in your github account and label it. You can add a description to your repository.
In your terminal you can create a folder using mkdir.
We have to initialise it by the use of git init and run it on the terminal.
We can commit our work by the use of git commit -m "Anything you would want to write".
To checkthe branch wheree your work has been set you usegit branch -M "main".
git remote add origin is used to link your account using the ssh key found on your github .
To push your work to git hub you use git push -u origin "THe branch that your work is in".

Now that you are all set, you open a file in your folder where you will write your code.

### Challenge 1
#### Description
In this code challenge, we were supposed to write a code that prompts the user to input the marks of a student and after that it should calculate and show you the grade attained by the student. The grade range was between 0 to 100.
Any values that were either above 100 and any values that were below 0 were returned as Invalid.

##### SetUp
We started first by declaring the function studentMarks and passed a parameter of marks inside the parenthesis. We used the prompt input to prompt the user to write the marks of students so as to calculate the code.
We used the if ,else if and else statements to pass our arguments  and to assign the different ranges for the marks so as to print different grades for the student.
After the user has input the marks , the code should execute each line and find which range the marks should be in so as to print the grade of the student.

### Challenge 2
#### Description
In this challenge, we were supposed to write a code that inputs the speed of a car and calculates if its greater than 70. if it is greater than 70, it should calculate the number of demerits the driver gets and outputs them and if the number of demerit points were greater than 12, it should output "License Suspended"

##### SetUp
We declared the function inputSpeed and passed our parameter as speed inside the parenthesis. We used the prompt function to prompt the user to input speed of the car so as to execute the code.
We used the if and else statements to pass our arguments and execute the code which tells javascript the different outputs that is should print.

### Challenge 3
#### Description
In this challenge , we were to write a code that calculates the netsalary of a worker by removing the NHIF deductions , NSSF deductions and by removing the paye so as to find the netsalary.

##### SetUp
We started by declaring all the variables that we would need. We used the prompt function that would prompt the user to input the basic salary received without any deductions.We declared the different functions that were used to calculate for NHIF, NSSF and paye.We used the if, else if and else statements to pass in our arguments that would assign the different ranges so as execute the code and print out the necessary outputs.
We used the callback function to callback all of our functions so that the values can be logged in.
